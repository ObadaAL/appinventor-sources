In order to locally test Drive backup for App Inventor, you need to create a Google project on Google Cloud Platform 
in order to obtain the necessary credentials (client ID and secret) for accessing users' Drive. 

After creating and obtaining the necessary credentials, go to: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials, 
click on your project name and add the necessary redirect URIs:
		http://localhost:8888	
		http://localhost:8888/credential?uri=/?locale=pt	
		http://localhost:8888/credential?uri=/?locale=en	
		http://localhost:8888/credential?uri=/?locale=zh_CN

Make sure that the port number matches the one you use when you run your local server.

After creating the project and obtaining the necessary credentials, go to GoogleUtils.java in the appengine/../server package and either replace the credential variables values - as well as the application name - or create flags with the necessary 
values and the specified flag names in GoogleUtils.java.

Finally, in the same package (appengine/../server) make sure that the useGoogleDrive flag is set to true in LoginServlet.java.
